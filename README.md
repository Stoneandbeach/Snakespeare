\- Not Shakespeare, after five training epochs

This is a simple, hand-coded RNN for text synthesis using python. By default it uses Shakespeare's sonnets as the training text. As seen above, it seems to be inspired by both Elvish tongues and perhaps The Hitchhiker's Guide?

This RNN is very likely too simple to do any sort of good job of recreating Shakespeare, even after training for a very long time. However, it does quite quickly capture some of the punctuation, formatting and words of old Bill. It's gibberish, but... it kind of looks like a sonnet, doesn't it?

\- Also not Shakespeare, after 22 training epochs

Suddenly, it gets into the zone for just a moment, before slipping out again...
